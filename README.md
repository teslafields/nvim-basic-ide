# Neovim Kickstart Config

This repo contains my custom Neovim config, built on top of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). It's designed to provide a clean, modern setup with LSP support, autocomplete, formatting, and everything else you'd expect from a serious Neovim setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since the original video was recorded, Neovim has been updated to **v0.11.2** (as of 2025-07-13), and this config has been adapted accordingly.  
> If you're still on Neovim **v0.10.x**, use the legacy setup on the [v0.10.1 branch](https://github.com/hendrikmi/neovim-kickstart-config/tree/v0.10.1).
